It felt like a small win for my mental health. I think I’ll try to make this a daily habit.",

There’s something incredibly grounding about hearing birds chirping and watching the sun creep up over the rooftops. I brewed some tea, grabbed my notebook, and started writing without worrying about structure or grammar. It felt liberating to just pour my thoughts out. I realized I often start my mornings with noise—emails, notifications, headlines—when I should be starting them with calm. I’m going to try to protect my mornings more carefully from now on.",

But I forced myself to set a timer for 25 minutes and promised I wouldn’t stop until it rang. Those 25 minutes turned into 2 hours. I was in the zone, and by the time I looked up, the work was done. The relief I felt was almost physical, like a weight had been lifted. It made me realize that most of my hesitation comes from fear of starting, not from the work itself.

I opened one tab to check a fact, and 30 minutes later, I was reading about something completely unrelated. The day slipped through my fingers. By evening, I felt frustrated with myself.

Rolling the dough, cutting it into strips, and boiling it felt oddly meditative. I made a simple garlic and olive oil sauce, and it turned out surprisingly delicious.
